                <p>Hello, as you noticed my name is Luis, did you watch the animated movie Rango? I'm from the state of Durango, Mexico yes where the chamaleon finds it's name, in a little city called GÃ³mez Palacio, I work as a developer in a private security company. </p>
                <p>The main reason I'm here is to master Javascript so I can create apps to solve social problems. Also I'm looking for partners who wanna help me using their hands for coding, their brains for ideas, but also their spirit for create a better world. That's the dream.So if you have a similiar idea, count with me.</p>
                <p>On the other hand I like t.v. series, anime, beer, family, friends, soccer, having a good conversation about anything, anywhere with anyone. So if you wanna talk about making a change in our world, or what's your favorite type of music, I'm all eyes. </p>
